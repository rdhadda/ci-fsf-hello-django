ok so is my understanding correct initially item.done is set to True so when a user clicked the toggle button it starts off item.done(TRUE) = not item.done(FALSE) when the toggle is clicked item.done then becomes false and if it was to be clicked again it would become true?

Yes, your understanding is correct. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

Initial State and Toggle Action
Initial State:

Assume item.done is True.
First Toggle Click:

item.done is True.
The expression not item.done evaluates to not True, which is False.
So, item.done = not item.done assigns False to item.done.
Now, item.done is False.
Second Toggle Click:

item.done is now False (after the first toggle).
The expression not item.done evaluates to not False, which is True.
So, item.done = not item.done assigns True to item.done.
Now, item.done is True again.
Summary of Toggle Behavior
Initial Value: item.done = True
After First Click: item.done = False
After Second Click: item.done = True
After Third Click: item.done = False
After Fourth Click: item.done = True
Example to Clarify
Initial State:

item.done is True.
User Clicks Toggle Button (First Time):

item.done = not item.done:
item.done was True.
not item.done evaluates to False.
item.done is now set to False.
User Clicks Toggle Button (Second Time):

item.done = not item.done:
item.done was False.
not item.done evaluates to True.
item.done is now set to True.
Full Cycle Example
Initial: item.done = True
Click 1:
item.done = not item.done (initially True)
item.done = False
Click 2:
item.done = not item.done (initially False)
item.done = True
Click 3:
item.done = not item.done (initially True)
item.done = False
Click 4:
item.done = not item.done (initially False)
item.done = True
Conclusion
Each time the user clicks the toggle button, item.done switches (toggles) between True and False. So if item.done starts as True, the first click sets it to False, the second click sets it back to True, and so on. This is exactly how the toggle functionality is intended to work.
